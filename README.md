## TODO

The goal of this exercise is to test your backend coding abilities along with your
critical thinking and design skills. The task at hand is to build a skeleton failure
injection library in Java. It should support the ability to inject a delay or an exception.
You should create a simple API for your library, and provide simple tests which
exercise the key functionality.

There are two basic files included in this repository (`GremlinContext.java` and `Failure.java`)
which you can use as a starting point, or feel free to go your own way.

Best of luck, and please feel free to send and questions to
[admin@gremlininc.com](mailto:admin@gremlininc.com?subject=Frontend%20Programming%20Question).
