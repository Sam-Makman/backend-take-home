## TODO

The goal of this exercise is to test your backend coding abilities along with your
critical thinking and design skills. The task at hand is to build a skeleton failure
injection library in Java. It already supports the ability to inject a delay as
an example of how to implement failure. You should add the ability to throw an exception
as a failure mode.

In addition you should create a simple API for your library, and provide simple 
tests which exercise the key functionality. Keep in mind that Simplicity is one
of our guiding tenets and that this API should be relatively low-touch for customers.

There are three basic files included in this repository (`GremlinContext.java`,
`Failure.java` and `Delay.java`) which you can use as a starting point, or feel
free to go your own way.

Best of luck, and please feel free to send any questions to
[recruiting@gremlininc.com](mailto:recruiting@gremlininc.com?subject=Backend%20Code%20Sample).
